every row in a data frame this is generally a slow way to accomplish a given task and it's not very pandorable.
 For instance, if we wanted to write some code to iterate over all the of the states and generate a list of
the average census population numbers. We could do so
using a loop in the unique function. Another option is to use
the dataframe group by function. This function takes some column name or
names and splits the dataframe up into chunks based on those names,
it returns a dataframe group by object. Which can be iterated upon, and then returns a tuple where the first
item is the group condition, and the second item is the data
frame reduced by that grouping.
